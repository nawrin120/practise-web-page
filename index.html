            <p>In simplest terms, it’s a page on our website that explains what our business does.

                That sounds straightforward enough, right?
                Sure, it does. But, because of this, they’re occasionally treated like nondescript pieces of content,
                created to fulfill a requirement on a checklist.
                That’s selling those pages short, though. Get it right, and they go from a line item no one looks at, to
                an essential element of telling our company’s story.</p>

                A fish in an animal which lives in water. There are more than 30,000 species of fish living in the water
                bodies. Fish differs in the shape, size and colour. They all live in different part of the oceans,
                depending on their habitat. Some fishes even stays at the bottom of the oceans throughout their life.

                Fish breathe through their gills. They consume water from their mouth and pass it through their gills
                passage to breathe. “Gills are feathery organs full of blood vessel”.

                A fish use its fins to breathe. They push their body against the water by stretching their fins, this is
                why their backbone is so flexible.
